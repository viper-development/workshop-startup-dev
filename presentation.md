    - Learn Git! A bit.

    Makefile: Use 16:9 format

    We'll probably use that kind of projector plus it fits better
    for my images.

# Lunch Break (Be Back at 14:30h)

## Code Reviews

What is it good for?

[10 Minutes](http://www.tickcounter.com/10minutes)

## Code Reviews

- Quality
- Learning from each other.
- Can be partly automated!
- Iterate! More issues, higher difficulty and naturally more reviews.

## Commit Messages

```
setup: Install .coafile via package_data

When installing the .coafile to
distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib, we ignore that this
is not the installation directory in every case. Thus
it is easier, more reliable and platform independent to
let distutils install it by itself.

Fixes https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala/issues/269
```

## Iterate

- Change
- `git commit -a --amend` - replace your previous commit
- `git push --force`

## Rebase

![Rebase](rebase.png)

## Rebase (Excercise)

- `git fetch upstream`
- `git rebase -i upstream/master`
