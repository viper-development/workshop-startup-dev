# Software Development in Teams

This workshop covers a theoretical and practical introduction to high quality
software development in teams.

Participants will be introduced to Git, a version control system that is used
in open source and industry projects likewise. All participants will do a
contribution to a real open source project ([coala](http://coala-analyzer.org/))
to experience first hand, how a distributed software development workflow can be
implemented effectively.

This workshop is brought to you by your friends from
[ViperDev](http://viperdev.io/).

## Requirements

- It's ok if you don't know Git.
- Basic knowledge about programming is required.
- If you have more advanced knowledge about programming/software development,

  about Git and distributed development workflows.
