# Software Development in Teams

This workshop covers a theoretical and practical introduction to high quality
software development in teams.

Participants will be introduced to Git, a version control system that is used
in open source and industry projects likewise. All participants will do a
contribution to a real open source project with over 30 contributors
([coala](http://coala-analyzer.org/)) to experience first hand, how a
distributed software development workflow can be implemented effectively.

This workshop is brought to you by your friends from
[ViperDev](http://viperdev.io/).

most of his time maintaining and developing his open source project coala to
help developers improving their code quality without hassle. coala nowadays has
more than ten contributors every week and is present at conferences all around

conducts workshops for clients of his company Viper Development
([viperdev.io](http://viperdev.io/)), pursues a master degree in Computer

piece of software that supports developers during their whole workflow.
