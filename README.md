# Software Development in Teams

This workshop covers a theoretical and practical introduction to high quality
software development in teams.

Participants will be introduced to Git, a version control system that is used
in open source and industry projects likewise. All participants will do a
contribution to a real open source project with over 30 contributors
([coala](http://coala-analyzer.org/)) to experience first hand, how a
distributed software development workflow can be implemented efficiently. During
the contribution, they will learn valuable skills including:

- Using Git, basics as well as advanced features.
- Working efficiently on one project with a scalable team.
- Reviewing code.
- Automating quality control.

On the second day, participants will get a theoretical introduction on what
techniques can be helpful when managing an own software development team.
Quality and speed considerations concerning startups will be discussed and
evaluated. The day will be concluded with a few words on how and when to scale
a project appropriately followed by an open end Hackevening.

This workshop is brought to you by your friends from
[Viper Development](http://viperdev.io/).
