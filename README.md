# Software Development in Teams

This workshop covers a theoretical and practical introduction to high quality
software development in teams.

Participants will be introduced to Git, a version control system that is used
in open source and industry projects likewise. All participants will do a
contribution to a real open source project with over 30 contributors
([coala](http://coala-analyzer.org/)) to experience first hand, how a
distributed software development workflow can be implemented efficiently. During
the contribution, they will learn valuable skills including:

- Using Git, basics as well as advanced features.
- Reviewing code.
- Working efficiently on one project with a scalable team.
- Raising quality without effort.

On the second day, participants will get an introduction on what techniques can
be helpful when managing an own software development team. Quality and speed
considerations concerning startups will be discussed and evaluated. The day will
be concluded with a few words on how to scale a project appropriately followed
by an open end Hackevening where individual projects can be hacked on together.

This workshop is brought to you by your friends from
[Viper Development](http://viperdev.io/).

## About the Speaker

Lasse Schuirmann is a freelance software developer who cares passionately about
open source, collaboratively developed software. After he was awarded the Google
Summer of Code sholarship, he began mentoring several students while
administering the GSoC program for the GNOME organization. Currently he spends
most of his time maintaining and developing his open source project coala to
help developers improving their code quality without hassle. The coala project
group has over 50 contributors and is present at conferences all around the
world.

In his spare time, Lasse forges high quality (mostly python) software and
conducts workshops for clients of his company Viper Development
([viperdev.io](http://viperdev.io/)), pursues a master degree in Computer
Science and develops GitMate ([gitmate.io](http://gitmate.io/)), a hand crafted
piece of software that supports developers during their whole workflow.
